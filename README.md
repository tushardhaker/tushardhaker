# 👋 Hi, I'm Tushar Dhaker

I am a 3rd year B.Tech student at **JECRC Foundation College**, specializing in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in software development and enjoy building practical, real-world applications.

I have worked on **MyShop.Pro**, an e-commerce vendor management system, where I contributed to core features and gained experience with backend logic, database handling, and business workflows.

Currently, I am looking for **freelancing opportunities** where I can apply my skills, learn from real client requirements, and deliver reliable solutions.
